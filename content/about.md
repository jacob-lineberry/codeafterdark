## $ `whoami`

I'm Jacob Lineberry and I work as a Cloud Engineer at Chewy. I build platform tooling and infrastructure for engineering teams.

## $ `cat ~/README.md`

I focus on AWS automation, multi-region networking, developer platforms, and scaling infrastructure.

Before Chewy, I led cloud migrations and built platform engineering practices at a major telecom. I started out in networking, which still shapes how I think about system design.

Open to talk platform engineering, cloud architecture, or weird infra edge cases — jlineberry@gmail.com
